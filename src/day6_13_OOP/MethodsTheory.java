/*
 * A method is a function written inside a class. Since Java is an object-oriented language, we need to write the method inside some class.

Syntax of a method : returnDataType nameOfMethod() { //Method body}
The following method returns the sum of two numbers:
int mySum(int a, int b) {
	int c = a+b;
	return c;	//Return value
}

Calling a Method : 
A method can be called by creating an object of the class in which the method exists followed by the method call:

Calc obj = new Calc(); //Object Creation

obj.mySum(a , b); //Method call upon an object

Void return type : 
When we donâ€™t want our method to return anything, we use void as the return type. void show{}
